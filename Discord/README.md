# Discord themes
---
Update: This repo contains 2 (or more when I feel like it) themes:

- f.theme.css: Primary theme, contains message bubbles, dark/light mode support, changes a lot of things, **more frequently updated**
- OldProfile.theme.css: recreates the old Discord user profile, **less frequently updated**

As I ~~stop procrastinating~~ be more active, I will hopefully separate this repo into "big" themes (above) and "small" themes, which are either links to other mini themes or smaller themes of my own that change less.


```diff
- For some reason, the old sidebar CSS import doesn't work very well on Discord web. 
```
